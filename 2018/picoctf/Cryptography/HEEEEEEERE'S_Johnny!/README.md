> Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe theycan be used to get a password to the process. Connect with `nc2018shell2.picoctf.com 35225`. Files can be found here:[passwd](//2018shell2.picoctf.com/static/a488bb3c175bc843e0fbce95fff920d9/passwd)[shadow](//2018shell2.picoctf.com/static/a488bb3c175bc843e0fbce95fff920d9/shadow).
