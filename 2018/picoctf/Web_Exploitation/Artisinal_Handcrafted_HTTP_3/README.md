# PicoCTF_2018:  Artisinal Handcrafted Http 3

**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Points:** 300pt  
**Description:**

> We found a hidden flag server hiding behind a proxy, but the proxy has some..._interesting_ ideas of what qualifies someone to make HTTP requests. Lookslike you'll have to do this one by hand. Try connecting via `nc2018shell2.picoctf.com 36186`, and use the proxy to send HTTP requests to`flag.local`. We've also recovered a username and a password for you to use onthe login page: `realbusinessuser`/`potoooooooo`.

**Hint:**

> ['_Be the browser._  When you navigate to a page, how does your browser send HTTP requests?  How does this change when you submit a form?']
